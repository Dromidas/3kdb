Gnome: 
    -focus con primarily
    -str/wis will up your dmg, dex helps tanking some...not hugely
    -focus jump jet skill until ~glvl 50, then start pumping transpose.  you can't use it until glvl 60, but 50 is a good time to start pumping it so it's not 0 when you get it
    -int will help you get more ac when you reinforce, but if you're capping out, it won't help
    -get first two points of BA, then focus IS
    -stim efficiency pri though, stim regen is useful, I'd say BA 1-2, then stim eff, then IS, then stim regen
